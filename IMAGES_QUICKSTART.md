## 📋 Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Upload high-quality images (good lighting, clear)
- Use consistent aspect ratios for professional look
- Name files descriptively before uploading
- Order images logically (main view first)
- Keep image files under 5MB each for faster loading

### ❌ DON'T:
- Upload more than 10 images (system limit)
- Use very large images (>20MB) - they'll be rejected
- Delete images without checking first
- Upload non-image files (they'll be rejected)
