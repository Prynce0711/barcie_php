# Email and Discount System Updates

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Separate Discount Management from Booking Actions

**Problem:** When admin rejected a discount, the entire booking was also rejected.

**Solution:** Created a separate action `admin_update_discount` that handles discount approval/rejection independently from booking status.

#### Database Changes:
- Added `discount_status` column to `bookings` table with possible values:
  - `none` - No discount applied
  - `pending` - Discount awaiting admin approval
  - `approved` - Discount approved by admin
  - `rejected` - Discount rejected by admin

#### New Admin Actions:
1. **Booking Actions** (`admin_update_booking`):
   - Approve booking
   - Reject booking
   - Check-in
   - Check-out
   - Cancel booking

2. **Discount Actions** (`admin_update_discount`):
   - Approve discount
   - Reject discount

### 2. Email Notifications for All Status Changes

**Feature:** Guests now receive email notifications for every status change.

#### Email Templates Created:

1. **Booking Confirmation** (on creation):
   - Sent to guest immediately after booking
   - Includes receipt number, room/facility details, dates
   - Mentions discount status if applicable

2. **Booking Approved**:
   - Green-themed email confirming booking approval
   - Includes booking details

3. **Booking Rejected**:
   - Red-themed email explaining booking couldn't be approved
   - Professional and courteous tone

4. **Check-in Confirmed**:
   - Blue-themed email confirming guest has been checked in
   - Wishes guest a pleasant stay

5. **Check-out Complete**:
   - Purple-themed email confirming check-out
   - Thanks guest and invites them back

6. **Booking Cancelled**:
   - Orange-themed email notifying of cancellation
   - Advises guest to contact if they didn't request it

7. **Discount Approved**:
   - Green-themed email confirming discount approval
   - Notes that booking still needs separate approval

8. **Discount Rejected**:
   - Red-themed email explaining discount couldn't be approved
   - Notes that standard rates apply
   - Clarifies booking can still be approved separately

### 3. Improved Email Storage

**Changes:**
- Guest email is now properly stored in booking `details` field
- Format: `... | Email: guest@example.com | ...`
- Allows system to extract email for all notifications

### 4. Admin Notification

**Feature:** Admin receives email when guest applies for discount.

**Includes:**
- Guest details
- Contact information
- Discount type and details
- Link to view proof document
- Booking details

## How to Use in Dashboard

### For Booking Management:
```javascript
// Approve/Reject/Checkin/Checkout/Cancel booking
action: 'admin_update_booking'
booking_id: [ID]
admin_action: 'approve' | 'reject' | 'checkin' | 'checkout' | 'cancel'
```

### For Discount Management:
```javascript
// Approve/Reject discount separately
action: 'admin_update_discount'
booking_id: [ID]
discount_action: 'approve' | 'reject'
```

## Example Workflow

1. **Guest books a room with senior discount:**
   - Booking status: `pending`
   - Discount status: `pending`
   - Guest receives: "Booking Confirmation" email
   - Admin receives: "New Discount Application" email

2. **Admin approves discount:**
   - Action: `admin_update_discount` with `discount_action=approve`
   - Discount status changes: `pending` → `approved`
   - Booking status: Still `pending` (unchanged)
   - Guest receives: "Discount Approved" email

3. **Admin approves booking:**
   - Action: `admin_update_booking` with `admin_action=approve`
   - Booking status changes: `pending` → `confirmed`
   - Discount status: `approved` (unchanged)
   - Guest receives: "Booking Approved" email

4. **Guest checks in:**
   - Action: `admin_update_booking` with `admin_action=checkin`
   - Booking status: `confirmed` → `checked_in`
   - Guest receives: "Check-in Confirmed" email

5. **Guest checks out:**
   - Action: `admin_update_booking` with `admin_action=checkout`
   - Booking status: `checked_in` → `checked_out`
   - Guest receives: "Check-out Complete" email

## Testing

To test the email functionality:
1. Create a booking with a valid email address
2. Check guest email for booking confirmation
3. Use admin dashboard to approve/reject discount
4. Check guest email for discount decision
5. Use admin dashboard to approve booking
6. Check guest email for booking approval

## Troubleshooting

If emails aren't sending:
1. Check PHP error log: `C:\xampp\php\logs\php_error.log`
2. Verify SMTP settings in `database/mail_config.php`
3. Check spam/junk folder
4. Ensure Gmail 2FA and App Password are configured correctly
5. Look for error logs starting with "Email send result:" or "Status change email to:"
